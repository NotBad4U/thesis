\chapter*{Abstract}
Powerful modern automated theorem provers are increasingly used to establish the correctness of critical computer systems.
Among them, Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers play a central role thanks to their expressive power and efficiency in handling complex logical reasoning tasks.
However, their size and complexity make full formal verification of their implementations impractical, raising a fundamental question of trust:
\begin{center}
\emph{Can we trust the correctness of their results?}
\end{center}

A promising answer lies in \emph{proof logging}, where solvers produce proof traces that proof checkers can independently check.
The Alethe format has recently emerged as a unified framework for representing such SMT proofs.
Several SMT solvers have adopted the Alethe format.
However, Alethe lacks a certified proof checker, limiting its adoption and trustworthiness.

In this thesis, we propose a reconstruction framework that translates Alethe proof traces into the Lambdapi proof assistant, an implementation of the $\lpm$-calculus modulo rewriting.
Lambdapi is a foundational proof assistant based on dependent type theory and rewriting rules, intended to serve as a pivot for exchanging proofs between interactive proof assistants.
We present a modular encoding of SMT logic and Alethe rules in Lambdapi, covering core theories such as first-order reasoning and linear arithmetic.

We detail the reconstruction process, which requires techniques such as proof by reflection and the elaboration of solver-specific simplifications.
Finally, we evaluate our implementation on benchmark examples and demonstrate that Alethe proofs generated by modern SMT solvers can be efficiently and reliably reconstructed in Lambdapi, paving the way toward portable and independently verifiable SMT proofs.
