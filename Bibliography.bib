abstract="This article describes the rationale for formal methods and considers the benefits, weaknesses, and difficulties in applying these methods to digital systems used in critical applications. It suggests factors for consideration when formal methods are offered in support of certification in a context such as DO-178B (the guidelines for software used on board civil aircraft) [40]. The presentation is intended for those to whom these topics are new. A more technical discussion of formal methods is available as a technical report [42].",

	abstract = {We investigate a simple game paradigm for intuitionistic logic, inspired by Wajsberg’s implicit inhabitation algorithm and Beth tableaux. The principal idea is that one player,  ∃ros, is trying to construct a proof in normal form (positions in the game represent his progress in proof construction) while his opponent, ∀phrodite,  attempts to build a counter-model (positions or plays can be seen as states in a Kripke model). The determinacy of the game (a proof-construction and a model-construction game in one) implies therefore both completeness and semantic cut-elimination.},

abstract = {The logical framework of Constrained Horn Clauses (CHC) models verification tasks from a variety of domains, ranging from verification of safety properties in transition systems to modular verification of programs with procedures. In this work we present Golem, a flexible and efficient solver for satisfiability of CHC over linear real and integer arithmetic. Golem provides flexibility with modular architecture and multiple back-end model-checking algorithms, as well as efficiency with tight integration with the underlying SMT solver. This paper describes the architecture of Golem and its back-end engines, which include our recently introduced model-checking algorithm TPA for deep exploration. The description is complemented by extensive evaluation, demonstrating the competitive nature of the solver.},
